### Hello ðŸ‘‹

Software developer emphasizing in JavaScript, but ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Java. I enjoy continuously learning and am open to any guidance, or suggestions so send them my way! 


*Fun Fact: On days where the responsibility is at its lowest, and I find myself deprived of movement, I am watching anime - or working on a personal project.* âœ¨
