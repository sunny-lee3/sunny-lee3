### Hello ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on BountyExpress. The vision for this web application is to create a social network, that will allow users to express an imagination and make those dreams a reality. This is a continuation project from "Bounty" (this web application uses a users dream but with ice-cream), and will have additional features and an entirely different user story. The same concept will remain. 

As any engineer does, I am continuously learning and am open to any guidance, or suggestions so send them my way!
